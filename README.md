### Research Questions

A greater speed of information-processing may facilitate evidence acquisition during decision making and memory updating and give rise to advantages in general cognitive abilities. This in this study we explore this hypothesis by using a hierarchical Bayesian cognitive modeling approach to investigate if individual differences in the velocity of evidence accumulation (a drift-diffusion model parameter that explains some variance in reaction times; RT) mediate the relationship between neural processing (estimated by event-related potentials; ERP) and general cognitive abilities (measured by intelligence tests; IQ)

### Hypothesis

Individual differences in cognitive abilities, a latent variable related to IQ scores, are explained by individual differences in ERP latencies. This relationship is at least partially reflected in individual differences in evidence accumulation (estimated by drift-diffusion model parameter fits).
